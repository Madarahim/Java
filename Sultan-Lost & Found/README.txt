DESCRIPTION:

"Sultan - Lost and Found" is a 2D-Platformer video game that I'm developing using Java. 
My dog, Sultan, unfortunately passed away a few years ago, so I thought I should try to 
immortalize my memory of him using my passion of Software Development. The game engine is 
done, so all that's left for me to do is get creative and design new levels and new enemies. 
The first level is done and is filled with a random amount of bad guys. The frog enemy still 
has issues I'm working on, but everything else works fine.
